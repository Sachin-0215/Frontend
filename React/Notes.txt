 By just creating a react element it won't automatically render on the dom ( you need to make some extra effort).



How react element looks like : - 

{
	type : 'button'
	props : { //props are attribute in an property that you are given in an html
		className : 'btn btn-primary',
		childeren : 'submit',
	}
} //this is react element that looks like

		        ||
		        V

	equivalent html looks like this
	
	<button class='btn btn-primary'>
			submit
	</button>
