Lecture 2 : DOM (document object model )
this document that we are talking about is the html document

when your browser has to read some basic html elements, HTML is render in a form of tree (generic tree or nary tree (node that have child 0 or more than 1 ) ) 
why tree because html elements is itself a hierachical kind of a tree, there exist a parent child relationship this html dom obj tree is actually prepare or render at runtime inside your corresponding browser internally .

Lecture 4 : Script Tags
Steps how browser loads websites when script tag is also present
1. the browser fetch the html pages.
2. It begins parsing the HTML pages and create a dom tree.
3. while parsing it encounter the script tag refering the external file
4. Browser request the external file and blocks the parser Hence parsing of html is halted
5. Once the script is downloaded it is executed subsequently and parser restart


Any (JS)  is capable to insert its own html doc using various function , That means the parser needs to wait until the script is not just downloaded but executed as well
